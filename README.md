⚠️ Notes
Background and image links such as C:\Users\Admin\Pictures\... or E:\... are local paths and won’t load on other systems. Replace them with online URLs or relative file paths for deployment.

Facebook iframe only loads properly when hosted over the web with valid embedding permissions.

This project is static; no backend is implemented for order saving or form processing.

📌 Recommended Improvements
Move all image assets to a local assets/ folder or host them online.

Add form handling and database for real cart and order tracking.

Make site responsive for mobile screens.

Integrate payment gateways (e.g., GCash API) if planning full online service.
